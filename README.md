## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 1. **Using the Command-Line Interface**

If the project provides a CLI tool (e.g., `sumryai.py`):

```bash
python sumryai.py --input your_text_file.txt --output summary.txt --length short
```

- `--input`: Path to the input file containing the text to summarize.
- `--output`: (Optional) Path to save the summary. If omitted, prints to console.
- `--length`: (Optional) Summary length (`short`, `medium`, `long`). Default is `medium`.

### 2. **Using as a Python Module**

You can import and use the summarizer in your own Python scripts:

```python
from sumryai import summarize

text = "Your long document goes here..."
summary = summarize(text, length="short")
print(summary)
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

- You can adjust configuration parameters (such as summary length, language, etc.) in the `config.py` file or via CLI arguments if available.
- API keys or external model credentials (if required) should be placed in a `.env` file (see `.env.example`).

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "Your text to summarize."}' \
     http://localhost:5000/summarize
```
